			Irina, oh Irina, with a smile so bright and fair,
			Your beauty shines like the sun, filling the air.
			With grace and poise, you walk and you move,
			A precious gem, that's hard to improve.

			Your laughter, it sparkles, like diamonds on display,
			A symphony of joy, that brightens the day.
			Your kindness and warmth, a beacon of light,
			A guide for the lost, in the dark of the night.

			So here's to you, Irina, my love and my friend,
			A poem of admiration, that I hope will not end.
			For you are the best, in my eyes you'll always be,
			My Irina, forever and always, you'll be the one for me.
