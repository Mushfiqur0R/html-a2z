			<p align="justify">Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Irina who lived in a beautiful village surrounded by rolling hills and lush forests.Irina was known throughout the village for her kindness, her infectious laughter, and her adventurous spirit.One day, while exploring the nearby woods, Irina came across a small, injured bird.</p> <p align="justify"> She carefully picked it up and brought it back to her cottage, where she nursed it back to health. The bird, so grateful for Irina's help, granted her a wish. Irina wished for the ability to understand the language of birds, and to her delight, her wish was granted.  From that day on, Irina spent much of her time in the forest, listening to the songs and stories of the birds. She learned about the secrets of the trees, the flight patterns of the birds, and the magic that lived in the hearts of all creatures.  Years went by, and Irina grew to be a wise and respected member of the village.</p> <p>She used her newfound knowledge to help others, and she lived a long, happy life filled with love, laughter, and the songs of the birds.</p>
